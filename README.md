A collection of reusable value objects written in PHP and targeting versions 5.6 and above. Value objects are essential building blocks of **Domain Driven Design** approach and described by Martin Fowler in _P of EAA page 486_ as below:

> "Value object is a small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn't based on identity."

> &ndash; Martin Fowler

All classes in this library annotated as `ORM\Embeddable` with appropriately adjusted column attributes. This makes them ready to use in any project with Doctrine ORM as [Embeddables](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.io/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/tutorials/embeddables.html).

## Installation & Usage
Install the library using [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```bash
$ composer require biberlabs/ddd-embeddables
```

and use it in your entities:

```php
<?php

namespace MyApp\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use DDD\Embeddable\EmailAddress;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class User {

    /**
     * @ORM\Embedded(class="DDD\Embeddable\EmailAddress")
     */
    private $email;

    // Returns an EmailAddress instance, not a string
    public function getEmail();

    // Use type-hinting if you need a setter
    public function setEmail(EmailAddress $email);
}
```

Afterwards, you can write custom [DQL queries](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html) based on your requirements while accessing properties of the value objects such as:

```sql
SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.email = :email
-- OR
SELECT p FROM Payments p WHERE p.total.currency = :currency
SELECT p FROM Payments p WHERE p.total.amount > 1000
-- OR
SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name.surname = :surname
SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name.title = :title
```

Value objects enables us to write much more cleaner and readable rules when dealing with the domain rules, application-wide. For example:

```php
$username  = $user->getEmail()->getLocalpart();
```

or

```php
$blacklist = ['spam4me.io', 'foo.com'];
if(in_array($user->getEmail()->getDomain(), $blacklist)) {
   // ...
}
```

even 

```php
if($company->hasMap()) {
    $latLng = $company->getAddress()->getGeoPoint()->toArray();
    //..
}

class Company
{
    // ...
       
    /**
     * Returns a boolean TRUE if the geolocation of the company is known,
     * FALSE otherwise.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function hasMap()
    {
        return $this->getAddress()->getGeoPoint() !== null;
    }
}
```
